## üß™ Test Plan Status

### Phase 1: Static Analysis ‚úÖ
- All Lua files created and syntax validated
- Dependencies properly configured
- Resource manifests updated

### Phase 2: Database Migration ‚è≥
- Migration file created and registered
- **Next**: Start server to apply migration automatically

### Phase 3: Server Startup ‚è≥
- **Next**: Start server and verify:
  - Authority migration applied successfully
  - No Lua errors in console
  - Resources load in correct order

### Phase 4: In-Game Testing ‚è≥
- **Next**: Test commands:
  - `/start_onboarding` - Test path selection
  - `/auth_add [id] [delta] [note]` - Test standing changes
  - `/authhud` - Test HUD toggle

## üöÄ Ready for Server Testing

The authority system is ready for server testing. All files are in place and configured correctly.

**Next Steps:**
1. Start the FiveM server
2. Check console for migration success message
3. Test authority features in-game
4. Verify database tables created correctly

## üìã Manual Verification Commands

Once server is running, verify in-game:
```lua
-- Test onboarding
/start_onboarding

-- Test admin commands (admin only)
/auth_add [playerid] [delta] [note]

-- Test HUD
/authhud
```

## üîç Database Verification

After server startup, check database:
```sql
-- Verify tables exist
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'player_meta';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'authority_events';
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'heat_zones';

-- Check migration applied
SELECT * FROM db_migrations WHERE filename='2025-01-09-authority.sql';
```
