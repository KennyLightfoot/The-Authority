# Staff Onboarding

## Access
- txAdmin ACL: group.admin for Sr. Staff, group.moderator for Mods.
- In-game staff tool: /staff (spectate, goto, bring, freeze, inv view, warn, kick, ban).

## Evidence & Mod-Log
- Every punitive action requires: reason code + short note.
- System writes DB mod-log + Discord webhook with player id, coords, timestamp.

## Escalation
- Warn → Kick → 24h Ban → Appeal queue (tickets) → Sr. Staff review.

## Privacy
- No PII in screenshots or public posts; redact identifiers in Discord when sharing outside mod channels.
